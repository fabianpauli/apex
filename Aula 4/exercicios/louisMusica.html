  <h1><strong>Wonderful World</strong> / Louis Armstrong</h1>
    <p>
        I see trees of green, <br>
        Red roses too <br>
        I see them bloom <br>
        For me and you <br>
        And I think to myself, <br>
        What a wonderful world
      <br>
    
        I see skies of blue <br>
        And clouds of white, <br>
        The bright blessed day, <br>
        The dark sacred night <br>
        And I think to myself, <br>
        What a wonderful world <br>
        --------------
    
      <br>
        The colors of the rainbow <br>
        So pretty in the sky <br>
        Are also on the faces <br>
        Of people going by <br>
        I see friends shaking hands, <br>
        Saying: "How do you do?" <br>
        They're really saying <br>
        "I love you" <br>
        --------------
        <br>
        I hear babies crying, <br>
        I watch them grow <br>
        They'll learn much more, <br>
        than I'll never know <br>
        And I think to myself, <br>
        What a wonderful world <br>
        -------------- <br>
        Yes, I think to myself, <br>
        What a wonderful world <br>
    </p>
